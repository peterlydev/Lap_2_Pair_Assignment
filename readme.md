## Process

Jaxsan, Sami and myself were teamed up for this challenge. We started off by reading the challenge requirements thoroughly. We then had an idea of what to do in terms of backend. We referred back to the Lap 2 exercises where we were able to see how to configure the docker compase file. We then moved on to creating database tables and what to include in them. 


After creating these tables, we then proceeded to the controllers, models and routes, which worked really well after testing them via Insomnia. After a few successful tests in accordance to GET and POST, we moved onto the front end.


For the front-end we started off with creating a HTML file which contained a form with 3 boxes (Title, Author and Body), we added a placeholder on each of them. We then used Bootstrap to design both the forms and buttons (Back and Submit). After this we moved onto the Front-end JavaScript where we started to add event listeners and ensuring the data is pushed to the back-end.


## Wins & Challenges

### Wins

* Able to create configurations for the backend
* Able to add new routes
* Able to push data to the backend (CRUD)
* Managed to get SQL up and running in good time

### Challenges

* Getting the front-end to work as expected
* Having to research on new functions such as windows.location.hash
* Configurating the URL (When submitting a post, the URL will change automatically) - Took longer than usual.
* Functioning the back button
